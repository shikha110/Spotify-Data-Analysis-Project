Description: 

In this project, we'll delve into a comprehensive Spotify dataset, encompassing various attributes related to tracks, albums, and artists. Utilizing SQL (Structured Query Language), we'll tackle an end-to-end process that includes:

1. Data normalization: Transforming the denormalized dataset into a well-structured format.
2. Querying: Executing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced) to extract insights.
3. Optimization: Enhancing query performance for efficient data retrieval.

The primary objectives are:

- Honing advanced SQL skills
- Uncovering valuable insights from the Spotify dataset

Through this project, we'll demonstrate expertise in data analysis, query optimization, and SQL proficiency, ultimately gaining a deeper understanding of the Spotify data landscape.
